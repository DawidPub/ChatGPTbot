- **Progress tracking**: Shows line numbers and truncates long lines for readability
- **Real-time updates**: Response appears in the GUI as it's being generated

### 2. Separate Response Callback
- **New callback system**: Added `response_callback` parameter to `ChatGPTBot` class
- **Real-time display**: Response field updates continuously as text is received
- **Immediate feedback**: Users can see partial responses while ChatGPT is still generating

### 3. Improved GUI Features
- **Clear Response button**: New button to clear the response display
- **Better threading**: Non-blocking operations for smoother user experience
- **Auto-clear**: Response field clears automatically when asking a new question

### 4. Enhanced Status Reporting

- **Progress indicators**: Shows when response is being generated vs. completed
- **Error handling**: Better error messages and status updates

## Technical Implementation

### ChatGPTBot Class Changes
```python
# New constructor with response callback
def __init__(self, status_callback=None, response_callback=None):

# New methods added:
def update_response(self, text):          # Updates response display
def log_response_line(self, line, line_number=None):  # Logs individual lines
```

### GUI Class Changes  
```python
# New method for updating response display
def update_response_display(self, text):  # Real-time response updates
def clear_response(self):                 # Clear response field
```

### Real-Time Processing
- **Continuous monitoring**: Checks for response changes every second
- **Live updates**: Response field updates as text changes
- **Line-by-line analysis**: Each line is logged and displayed immediately
- **Completion detection**: Identifies when response is fully generated

## User Experience Improvements

- Manual response field management

### After  
- **Live response streaming**: See text appear as it's generated
- **Detailed progress logs**: Track each line being received
- **Clear feedback**: Know exactly what's happening at each step
- **Better control**: Clear response button for easy reset
