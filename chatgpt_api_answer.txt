Pydantic AI (also referred to as Pydantic, not to be confused with "AI" in name) is a Python library designed to:
Validate, parse, and serialize data using Python type annotations.
It’s widely used in modern Python applications, especially those involving APIs, databases, and configuration management.
🔍 Core Features
Feature Description
✅ Data Validation Automatically validates input data using Python type hints (str, int, List[...], Optional[...], etc.)
🔄 Parsing & Serialization Converts JSON and other data formats to Python objects (and vice versa)
🛡️ Type Safety Detects type mismatches at runtime
🚀 Performance Fast validation using compiled code (Pydantic v2 uses pydantic-core in Rust)
🌐 Framework Integration Works seamlessly with FastAPI, SQLModel, and more
🧠 Example
python
Kopiuj
Edytuj
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

user = User(id='123', name='Alice', email='alice@example.com')
print(user.id)  # 123 (auto-casted from str to int)
⚙️ Typical Use Cases
FastAPI: Validating request/response bodies
Data pipelines: Ensuring schema consistency
Config files: Parsing .json, .env, or .yaml settings
ORMs & DTOs: Clear data models
🆕 Pydantic v2 Highlights
Written in Rust for speed (pydantic-core)
Better performance (up to 50x faster in benchmarks)
Improved custom field validation
Still backward-compatible for most v1 usage
If you were referring to something different by Pydantic AI (e.g., a company or new product), let me know — but most likely you meant the Python data validation library, Pydantic.
